### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I have two main passions in my llife, music and coding. Just like reading notes, coding requires extensive knowledge and understanding. Thus, I have been honing my skills to become a Software Engineer at two institutes, AMA University and Avion School.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my portfolio.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby on Rails.
